Welcome to the C-Like Compiler project! This repository contains a Python implementation of a lexer and parser for a C-like language, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. This README file will guide you through the setup process and explain how to use the application effectively.
 Below is an overview of the grammar rules implemented in this project:
1. Lexical Elements:

    Keywords: The language includes keywords such as if, else, while, and for.
    Identifiers: Identifiers are sequences of letters, digits, and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore.
    Literals: The language supports integer, floating-point, and string literals.
    Operators: Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and assignment operator (=) are supported.
    Punctuation: Delimiters like parentheses (), braces {}, semicolons ;, and newline characters \n are used to structure the code.
2. Test Cases
test_case1.txt, test_case2.txt and test_case2.txt each contains sample code for testing the C-Like Compiler:
